I've been working on a fun and challenging project that combines problem-solving with the elegance of algorithms. Introducing my Sudoku Solver and Generator in Java! 🚀

🔢 Random Puzzle Generation        
a)The generatePuzzle method creates a Sudoku puzzle that is either solvable or unsolvable based on a random boolean value.                                  
b)If solvable is true, the board is filled with a valid Sudoku solution and then some numbers are removed to make it a puzzle.                                                
c)If solvable is false, random numbers are placed on the board without ensuring that the board is solvable.                                               

🛠️ Main Method                                                       
Generates a new puzzle, prints it, attempts to solve it, and then prints the final board state.                                              

📊 printBoard Method                                
Prints the Sudoku board in a readable format.  

🔍 isSafe Method                                                                  
Checks if placing a number in a particular cell is valid according to Sudoku rules.                                                                

🔄 solve Method                                      
Uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.                                                                        


This project was an amazing experience, enhancing my understanding of algorithms, problem-solving, and Java programming. Looking forward to diving into more such projects and sharing my journey with you all!
